/*
This is the code to automate the Dell Warranty API. Not code here should need to be altered and not manually executions are needed
The offical backend sheet imports the data from this sheet using ImportRange(). With that it will update live when the spreadsheet is altered
There are two automated triggers created to execute the code:
1. Daily Trigger - This runs every day between 5am and 6am and calls function dailyMain()
  This functions purpose is to append dell warranty information to the bottom of the spreadsheet for devices that have no information currently (newly added devices)
2. Weekly Trigger - This runs once a week on a Monday between 1am and 2am and calls function weeklyMain()
  This functions purpose is to overwrite all data and repopulate it. This is done so all warranty is accurate in case extended or new warranty is purchased

NOTE: The Queried Serial column on the right is a helper column. It has pre-queried all Dell devices in the asset register to save computing time.
NOTE: There is also always the potential that some warranty is missing or not entirely accurate (it would be quite rare if at all). This is due to some device models having the same warranty
  but giving it different naming conventions. So there could be an older device with a one off naming convention for ADP or it could happen for new ones.

ISSUES:
Errors in code - The only errors occuring should hopefully be issues on Dells side from testing. If an error is thrown it will just execute the next day so no worry
  If errors become frequent error handling can be easier implemented
Queried Serial Numbers missing Dell Devices - This issue will be with the query itself not the code here. It queries "TCE Supplied Device - BackEnd" All Devices Google Sheet.
  It has to filter for only Dell devices, however there are issues where some serial numbers have blank information usually because they have never been turned on for CompInfo to pull 
  the devices information. So tweaking on the query may be needed overtime to include all devices or there needs Glenn needs to fix All Devices sheet (wouldn't be too hard).
Queried Serial Numbers are doubled up - This would most certainly be due to the "TCE Supplied Device - BackEnd" All Devices google sheet. It most likely has 2 records
